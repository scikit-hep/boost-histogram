Bool and category axes
----------------------

Taken together, the flexibility in axes and the tools to easily sum over
axes can be applied to transform the way you approach analysis with
histograms. For example, letâ€™s say you are presented with the following
data in a 3xN table:

============== ========================
Data           Details
============== ========================
``value``
``is_valid``   True or False
``run_number`` A collection of integers
============== ========================

In a traditional analysis, you might bin over ``value`` where
``is_valid`` is True, and then make a collection of histograms, one for
each run number. With boost-histogram, you can make a single histogram,
and use an axis for each:

.. code:: python3

   value_ax = bh.axis.Regular(100, -5, 5)
   bool_ax = bh.axis.Integer(0, 2, underflow=False, overflow=False)
   run_number_ax = bh.axis.IntCategory([], growth=True)

Now, you can use these axes to create a single histogram that you can
fill. If you want to get a histogram of all run numbers and just the
True ``is_valid`` selection, you can use a ``sum``:

.. code:: python3

   h1 = hist[:, True, sum]

You can expand this example to any number of dimensions, boolean flags,
and categories.
